A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away - well, 1992 in London to be exact, as we couldn't find Tatooine - we had three grand in our back pocket and a firm belief that there is a second hand market for computers, gadgets and video games. Increasing obsolescence was rapidly increasing the need to recycle.
<br><br>
We also thought that the staff at Rumbelows were crap - we, as custies, wanted to know what we were buying, in ever-increasing technical gadgets and silicon, and ever-increasing catalogues of games and movies.
<br><br>
We couldn't afford the most exotic kit or get rid of our old kit. What's a geek to do?

We wanted a retailer where one could pick up second hand oldies-but-still-goodies at knockdown prices. And we genuinely all cared about the environment - we're hippies, but dressed unhippyishly stupid as to not admit we like the Grateful Dead, Syd and Led Zeppelin which we know everyone secretly does.

We also didn't want a store stuffing rubbish in our faces, a retailer that colluded with software houses and hardware manufacturers to hard flog what they couldn't shift. We would sell everything at the market price, if something doesn't sell, we reduce the price and if it sells too well, we increase the price. Simple market economics.

The first CeX (Complete Entertainment Exchange), then known as the easy off the tongue 'Tottenham Court Road Computer Exchange' opened in a small shop at the top of Whitfield Street. Tucked behind the top end of Tottenham Court Road - London's electronics and computer heartland - CeX's mix of cheap second hand games, hard to find Japanese and US imports and computer bits and bobs, soon found a fanatically loyal band of customers dubbed affectionately as custies. Many of these custies have since joined the company as it has blossomed.

It became clear that we'd need to open a new store to keep up with demand (and supply). Our Rathbone Place shop opened in 1993 taking over Pilot Software City, a place well known to London based Apple IIe and Atari 800 gamers. CeX took over and concentrated on console gaming - SNES, Neo, Megadrive, Engine and Game Boy, leaving the Whitfield Street branch to focus on the computing side of the geek within. Pilot and CeX has been selling games at this location continuously for over 30 years - the longest-running gaming location in the world? Let us know if you know differently, we'd love to find out.
